                        Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates independently of a central bank. It is decentralized, meaning it operates on a network of computers rather than being controlled by a single entity. The first and most well-known cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, but there are many others, including Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin. Cryptocurrencies are often used as investments and for online transactions, but their regulation and security remain controversial.

                <h4>At the time, nobody knew that Bitcoin would become what it is today. Nobody knew that it would be the start of a huge technological movement… but it was. It was the beginning of cryptocurrencies — the beginning of a new era.</h4>
                <P class="bit_p">
                    In 2013-14, Bitcoin grew a lot. Then, it slowed down a bit. But in 2017, the market for Bitcoin went up, up and further up. This time, it went a lot further.<br>

                    In December 2017, Bitcoin reached a price of $20,000 per Bitcoin. So, anyone holding 50 Bitcoins or more became a millionaire. In January 2015, 50 Bitcoins would have cost you just $10,000. That's a profit of $990,000! Crazy, right?<br>
                </P>
                <h4>What is it?</h4>
                <p class="bit_p">
                    It is a digital currency that you can send to other people. This may be as a gift, for services or for a product. You get the idea — it's just like the money we use in our bank accounts (USD, EUR, etc.). But it's digital; it isn't physical.<br>

                    However, that isn't all that makes it different. It's also decentralized, meaning it doesn't rely on a bank or third party to handle it — this I explained earlier in my definition of a cryptocurrency.<br>

                    With Bitcoin, each transaction happens directly between users — it's called a peer-to-peer network. This is all possible thanks to the blockchain. Bitcoin introduced blockchain technology to allow users to send and receive Bitcoin without using a third party.<br>

                    Because you don't need a third party, you don't need to identify yourself. You can make payments without revealing who you are.<br>

                <p>TCreated in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin Bloomberg, Ethereum is much more than just being a digital currency, making it, the second-best currency for people to invest in. It is a blockchain technology-based platform for developing decentralized apps and smart contracts. Smart contracts are the agreements coded on the blockchain that execute themselves when certain pre-set conditions are fulfilled. What sets Ethereum apart from the other types of cryptocurrency is that you can start building directly on the Ethereum network blockchain.</p>

            <p>
            After reading this guide, you should be much more familiar with the most popular cryptocurrencies when it comes to both trading (on exchanges such as Kraken or Binance) and technology, and the different types of cryptocurrency that exist. You know how they are different from one another, and you understand some of the pros and cons of each.

T           his puts you in a much better position to start doing further research and making your own opinion on each of them.
